<img src="https://github.com/BurykinaA/Arcade-game-Bomberman-/blob/main/start.PNG" width="150">

This game is designed for one player and is made in the arcade genre. The player controls a character located on a randomly generated game location consisting of two types of blocks: destructible boxes and indestructible walls. The character itself is in the upper left corner of the map, can move on the grass. He can bet with a small gap during time bombs that explode after a fixed time and destroy boxes next to them. Thanks to the bombs, the player clears his way, as well as kills opponents (monsters). The character himself also takes damage if hit by the bomb. To pass to the next level you need to get to five   opponents and destroy them with the help of bombs that the player places on the level. The player receives one kill point. For each enemy destroyed by the character. The character has only 3 health points, which disappear if he falls into the zone of the explosion of the bomb left by him or stumbles upon the enemy. If all health points are lost, the player loses and the game restarts with first level. This will also reset the kill counter.

## Installation

Download SFML 2.5.1: https://www.sfml dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/

In order to use this application, you must download the svn repository from the link [1] and build the project using CMake. AT You can find the configuration file Doxyfile for doxygen in the sources. With his using it is possible to get the documentation of the Map class. At the same time, in folder where the project was built, when building docs, the html folder will appear, where documentation is located. After you need to set the path CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, where later all the necessary files will be installed, and being in the folder with the assembled project, type cmake --build on the command line. --target install, after which to the specified CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX path, three folders will be created: lib - contains library files with extensions .h and .cpp; bin - contains the application BomberMan.exe and the necessary SFML library files to run

Or you can download the archive and play :)
